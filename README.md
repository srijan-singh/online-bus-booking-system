# System Architecture for Online Bus Booking

## Components

* **User service:** This service is responsible for managing user accounts, including login, registration, and profile management.
* **Booking service:** This service is responsible for managing bookings, including creating, fetching, cancelling, and reviewing bookings.
* **Schedule service:** This service is responsible for managing schedules, including fetching, creating, and updating schedules.
* **Payment service:** This service is responsible for processing payments for bookings.
* **Route service:** This service is responsible for providing information about the bus routes, including origin, destination, duration, and amount.

## Interactions

* The user interacts with the user interface to log in, view their booking, and book a new bus.
* The user service fetches the user account from the database.
* The booking service fetches the booking of the user from the database, or creates a new booking if one does not exist.
* The schedule service fetches the schedule from the database, or creates a new schedule if one does not exist.
* The payment service processes the payment for the booking.
* The review and cancellation APIs are handled by the booking service.
* The ticket is generated by the schedule service and the route service.

## Considerations

* **Security:** The system should be secure to protect the user's data.
* **Scalability:** The system should be scalable to handle a large number of users.
* **Availability:** The system should be available to users 24/7.


# Backend (Microservice)

## API

This class is the base class for all the other classes in the code. It defines the protected properties `userAPI`, `bookingAPI`, `routeAPI`, `scheduleAPI`, and `paymentAPI`, which are the URLs for the different APIs.

### Methods

* `registerUser()`: Registers a new user.
* `loginUser()`: Logs in a user.
* `bookRide()`: Books a ride for a user.
* `cancelRide()`: Cancels a ride for a user.
* `reviewRide()`: Reviews a ride for a user.
* `getAllUsers()`: Gets all the users.

## UserAPI

This class extends the `API` class and provides methods for interacting with the user API.

### Methods

* `registerUser()`: Registers a new user.
* `loginUser()`: Logs in a user.
* `bookRide()`: Books a ride for a user.
* `cancelRide()`: Cancels a ride for a user.
* `reviewRide()`: Reviews a ride for a user.
* `getAllUsers()`: Gets all the users.

* `getRouteByOriginAndDestinnation()`: Gets all the routes with given origin and destination.
* `getAllOrigins()`: Gets all the origins.
* `getAllDestinations()`: Gets all the origins.
* `getAllRoutes()`: Gets all the routes.

## ScheduleAPI

This class extends the `API` class and provides methods for interacting with the schedule API.

### Methods
